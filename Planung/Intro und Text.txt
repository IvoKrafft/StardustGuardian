Welcome to the world of Stardust
There is a story told to every child in the land saying that the
Legendary Dragonslayer, known as the Stardust Guardian, is hoarding a giant
Treasure but to this day no one was able to get it out of his hand. Even
finding him is a great task itself. It is up to you to find the road to
the Slayer and get the treasure out of his hand. On your way you might
find a lot of dangerous creatures or you might find friends and other hidden
Treasures to aid you in your Quest but always beware of the Troll.
